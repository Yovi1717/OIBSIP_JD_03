Proud to Share My Third Project at Oasis Infobyte! 


I've recently developed a user-friendly Java program to simulate an ATM system. This console-based application allows users to manage their bank accounts by performing transactions such as withdrawals, deposits, transfers, and viewing transaction history. Leveraging Java and its core libraries, I created a practical tool for efficiently handling banking operations with clear prompts and outputs.


ðŸ“Š Key Highlights:


User interaction through console prompts

User authentication with user ID and PIN

Perform withdrawals, deposits, transfers, and view transaction history

In-memory storage for account information

ðŸ”§ Technical Skills Demonstrated:


Java Programming

Basic user input handling

Function implementation for ATM operations

Console-based user interface design

Big Thank you to Oasis Infobyte!
